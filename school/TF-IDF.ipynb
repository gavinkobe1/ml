    "# Text Analytics 1 - Preparatory Exercises\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a growing specialization in business analytics that is concerned with Text Analysis and natural language processing (NLP), as it allows businesses to interrogate the mass of unstructured data that exists about their customers, products and interactions - data that far outweighs the \"structured\" datasets we have considered up to now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing such data is non-trivial. Computers are good at understanding rigidly-structured data with limited variety. However, when we deal with unstructured free-form text, things begin to get difficult. Developing NLP applications for business is therefore challenging because computers have a hard time understanding underlying concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even within a single language there are many subtle variations to the way in which we communicate to consider - tone, sentiment, irony, dialects, context, slang, and so on. In order to solve this problem, NLP analysis has moved from simple statistical analysis, to the use of predictive models to underpin the way the function - Multinational businesses now use such techniques extensively to  deliver relevant results to their workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most common applications of NLP include search engines, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, part-of-speech tagging, entity recognition, and so on. The goal of NLP is to develop a set of algorithms so that a company can interact with text written in plain English to use some of the outputs in their businesses processes. We are going to explore how to do this below, in the context of customer reviews for products."

    "### Task 4c: The famous \"Bag of Words\" approach\n",
    "Instead of just counting words, we can actually use this simple approach to represent a document. This is called a \"bag of words\" approach, as the document is described with no regards to the ordering of the words, but simply their counts. This turns out to still be a very powerful and flexible approach, allowing us to compare the similarity between two pieces of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we use a \"Vector Space\" representation of a document. First we consider every word that can appear in a corpus (i.e. across all the documents we have) as a feature in it's own right. We then simply assign the value of that feature for any individual doucment, as the number of times that word appears. This means if we have M words in our \"dictionary\" of words that appear across the corpus, each document can be represented by m features, and we are back in our tradiaional home of seeing a document as a point in an m-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "By way of example consider a universe where the are only 3 possible words: \"Apple\", \"Orange\" and \"Banana\". Every sentence of document is made out of them. In this case every document can be represented in a 3 dimensional space. Each word is an axis of that space:\n",

    "Banana --> [0,1,0] <br/>\n",
    "Orange --> [0,1,0]\n",

    "dM = \"Banana Apple Orange\"                       --> [1, 1, 1] <br/>\n",

    "> 2. Words that have the same root (and hence the same meaning) are being treated differently (e.g. The words \"purchase\", \"puchasing\" and \"purchased\" have essentially the same meaning but look completely different to the analysis)\n",
    "> 3. In any given corpus there will be words that appear in a lot of documents. (e.g. in customer reviews of vehicles, words like \"car\", \"drive\", etc. are not paricularly useful in dilienating differences in reviews, as they will appear in every review!). We should deal with this.\n",

    "\n",
    "Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a very good solution for problems 3 in the above list. Currently we are using direct word/term counts (i.e. Term frequency). The approach we will try now accounts for the fact that some of those terms are in every document and so their importance should be weighted down...\n",

In the extreme case, where the word appears in large fraction of the documents, usually it is even better to completely eliminate the count - we will come to this in the stopwords section).\n",
    "\n",

In many search engines, something in between is used. However, in general for business cases, we simply use the amount of times a word occurs in the document - it's term frequency (\"TF\").\n",

    "While we have now weighted terms by importance, some words are just pointless to include in analyses, and just need to be eradicated. In text analytics, \"stop words\" are those words which are filtered out before we do our real analysis due to the fact they do not add any real semantic content but do add to the curse of dimensionality (in fact many stop-words exist in the language more for the purposes of redundancy and grammar than to add meaning).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Any group of words can be chosen as the stop words for a given purpose. For many business contexts (such as search engines) these tend to be common, short function words, such as \"the\", \"is\", \"at\", \"which\", and on. Occasionally this word removal can generate problems (there is famously a band called \"The The\" that suffers particularly badly from stop word filtering!).\n",
